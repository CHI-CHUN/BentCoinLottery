# BentCoinLottery

The lottery is a somewhat peculiar one: Each ticket for the lottery is a buyer-determined string of 30 1's and 0's. The winning lottery number is drawn by flipping a coin 30 times and reporting a "1" for heads and a "0" for tails. The same bent coin is always used, and it has a probability of 0.1 of turning up heads and a probability of 0.9 of turning up tails. The prize money for the lottery is $10,000,000, and each ticket costs only $1.
